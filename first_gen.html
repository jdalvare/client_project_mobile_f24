            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The First-Generation Student Program is grounded in a history of student activism. First-Generation College Students @UM, a student organization, was founded in 2007 with the mission to increase accessibility to resources for first-generation students and to build community among the population. The students advocated for greater campus support for themselves and other peer first-generation students. In 2017, University of Michigan hired the inaugural first First-Generation Program Manager, established the First-Generation Gateway Office, and launched multiple initiatives to increase first-generation student success. As a result, student engagement has increased significantly since 2017 and University of Michigan’s first-generation efforts have received national recognition.</p>
            <h2>Defining "First-Generation College Student" at the University of Michigan</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, we define first-generation college students as individuals whose parents or guardians have not attained a four-year college degree. This inclusive definition applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. While the University of Michigan adheres to this definition, all signature events organized by the University of Michigan’s First-Generation Student Gateway are accessible to any student who believes these resources could benefit them.</p>
